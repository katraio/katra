# Katra CMS

> **Note:** This project is in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for production use.

Katra is a simple and modular CMS that is built from several components (Composer packages) that can be swapped out easily for custom functionality. The intention is to provide a CMS that does not require the user to compromise on the functionality they need, while still being easy to use and maintain.
